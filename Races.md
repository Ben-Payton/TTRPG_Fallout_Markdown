# Race_traits
## Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the raceâ€™s expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores.
## Size
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Large (between 8 and 12 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently.
## Variant
Some races have variants. You can choose the variant version of the race at 1st level when creating your character and you gain any new traits associated with it. If there are two traits with the same name, the variant version takes precedence.
