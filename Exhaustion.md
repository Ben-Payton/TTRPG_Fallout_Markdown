Whenever you roll a d20, the total is subtracted by 1 for each level of exhaustion you have. When you gain your tenth level of exhaustion, you die. If you are a [[Human]], [[Ghoul]], or [[Super_mutant]]; you can remove one level of exhaustion after resting for at least 6 hours. If you are a [[Robots|Robot]] or [[Gen-2_Synth]]; you can remove one level of exhaustion after resting for at least 2 hours.
