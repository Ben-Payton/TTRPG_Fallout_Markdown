Every player has a two sided cap that they may flip at any time to gain advantage on a d20 roll, alternatively they may flip their Karma Cap after they roll a d20 to re-roll it and take the new result. However, the GM may also flip any playerâ€™s flipped karma cap to gain advantage or a reroll on a d20 roll. If a player with a flipped cap ever rolls a 1 on a d20 roll, they can flip one of their flipped Karma Caps, but cannot use that cap to re-roll the 1. If the GM ever rolls a critical hit against a player with a flipped cap, they may flip their cap. If your Luck ability score is equal to 10, you gain an additional Karma Cap.
